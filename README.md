## ‚ú® About This Project

The **Interactive Profile Card** is a creative take on the personal portfolio. Instead of a traditional scrolling page, all information is contained within a single, elegant card. The card dynamically changes its size and state to display different sections like "About," "Projects," and "Contact," creating a fluid, app-like experience.

This project focuses heavily on **CSS transitions, animations, and modern UI effects** to deliver a visually engaging presentation.

Sorry if I'm in a bad phase studying for this.
